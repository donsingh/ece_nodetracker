		The University of San Carlos - School of Engineering aims to implement energy management measures so that each of its departments becomes energy efficient. As a first step to attain such goal, each department as a responsibility center must first have information of its baseline energy utilization profile. Data is easily obtained if a department's loads are in distinct electrical branch circuits, which is not the case however since many of the departments' classrooms and other facilities are distributed among branch circuits that also serve other departments. Using a wireless sensor network, an electrical energy monitoring system is developed through which real-time data can be obtained from distributed utilization nodes. The system monitors at branch circuit level only those facilities for which a department, in this case, the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (DEEE), is responsible in terms of energy utilization. This study expects that the developed system that will come up with outputs of energy consumption data determining the system's effectiveness in monitoring the energy consumption of facilities distributed among mixed-user branch circuits. Hence, the potential of acquiring data in the case of indistinct and distributed electrical branch circuits is demonstrated using the developed system. Data acquired in this work will serve as a basis for further research work in energy management and in implementing effective energy management measures towards achieving the goal of energy efficiency.
